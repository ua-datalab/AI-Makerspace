_Sit down to code and discuss how to build AI applications with DataLab's scientists_

## Description
Put to practice your knowledge by having some hands-on experience in some of the latest cutting edge AI tools. In this series of workshops we will spend an hour each week developing and testing some advanced AI topics, such as fine tunning and LLM, creating a vector database for a _retrieval augmented generation_ application, distributed training with pytorch, among others.

Please attend our in-person AI Makerspace Meet-Ups @ Snakes & Lattes
