_Sit down to code and discuss how to build AI applications with DataLab's scientists_

## Description
Put to practice your knowledge by having some hands-on experience in some of the latest cutting edge AI tools. In this series of workshops we will spend an hour each week developing and testing some advanced AI topics, such as fine tunning and LLM, creating a vector database for a _retrieval augmented generation_ application, distributed training with pytorch, among others.

The workshop is fully virtual throug Zoom.

## Instructors
### Enrique Noriega
Enrique is a computational research scientist in the Department of Computer Science and the Data Science Institute. He has vast experience developing A.I. applications for the medical sciences and loves to work with deep learning models.

### Mithun Paul
Mithun is a research scientist in the Data Science Institute. His PhD is in Artificial Intelligence, with a specialization in Natural Language Processing. He also has 10+ years of experience the software industry leading research and development teams. He is currently heading the team developing UofA's own homegrown chatbot: AIVerde.
